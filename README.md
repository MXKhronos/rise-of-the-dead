# [Rise Of The Dead](https://github.com/MXKhronos/rise-of-the-dead)
This is the Rise Of The Dead community development documentation. The API is still in development and may just be experimental. I am making this for my educational purposes and there are no plans for it to be publicly used yet. Security holes in the API may allow users to escape the sandbox into the top stack, which is bad because the user will be able to take over the server.
